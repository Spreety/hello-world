# hello-world
Just trying out a repository
I originally thought I wanted to go into graphic design. I learned the baiscs of that but then thought I would take it a bit further and learn the basics of web design. From there I stumbled into the world of coding and discovered how much I enjoyed it. I am learning as much as I can through code academy and may eventually enroll in school to learn more. My hope is that someday I will be able to turn this into a career that I can really enjoy.
